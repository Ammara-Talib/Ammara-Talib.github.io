The shortage of GW in the WCS is caused by many factors, including climate variability, fast expansion of irrigation, increasing high-capacity wells, and increasing population. For sustainable water resource management, there is an urgent need to develop a computationally-efficient and easy-to-update framework with the capability of efficient incorporation of recently developed and regularly updated environmental datasets (e.g., remote sensing maps of evapotranspiration and soil moisture).\nThe research questions for this project include: Using computationally efficient ML models, can easy-to-obtain remote sensing derived environmental datasets be combined to accurately predict GW dynamics across the WCS? How does GW anomaly vary in space and across the WCS? How pumping and crop type change can influence this anomaly forecasting?\nStatic and dynamic variables were used to build LSTM model for prediction of GW depth at the 26 well locations in the WCS region monthly from 1958 to 2020.\nBased on the findings, overall palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and soil moisture has high correlation with GW elevation. Other Important predictor include previous 5-month Tmax and solar radiations.\nTwo-month GW anomaly forecast temporal model can explain variance 90% in Northern region. Model MAE is higher when previous month GWE has lower autocorrelation.\nIn our observations, negative anomaly means shallow GW, so pumping has greater influence on shallow GW.

The risks of climate extremes such as heat waves and droughts are increasing and have already threatened the North American agricultural system in the form of increased drought duration, intensity, and reduced crop yield. Current drought prediction models cover large regions and are not specific to individual farms. The goal of this study is 1) Forecast field-scale short-term evapotranspiration (ET) for different crops in the U.S. Midwest and 2) improve a commonly used satellite-driven regional crop evapotranspiration model (WISP). The first goal is achieved by building a prediction and forecasting empirical model based on machine learning. We compare two approaches, neural networks with Long short-term memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF) applied to nineteen crop sites in a range of crop types, soils, and irrigation usage that have continuous ET measurements made by eddy covariance. In general, performance of RF exceeded LSTM in most cases and forecasts were found to be reliable out to three days. Unlike rainfed crops, we found irrigated crops ET prediction requires including additional information related to physical properties of sites (soil types, crop coefficient, cumulative growing degree days). For the second goal, we evaluated ET predictions from WISP against some of these towers. Overestimation of ET in WISP arises from faulty parameterization of longwave radiation clear-sky emissivity. We applied an inverse approach to estimate corrected clear sky emissivity parameters. ET calculated based on corrected parameters reduced most of the model’s ET bias and lowered RMSE. New field-scale actual ET measurements provide critical insights to improve ET models and hence, enhance drought monitoring and forecasting necessary to be able to use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity.\n","date":1607990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607990400,"objectID":"6654dd016aa31a54c2f5ca9a275aa9d6","permalink":"/conferences/improving-irrigation-planning-and-early-prediction-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/improving-irrigation-planning-and-early-prediction-2020/","section":"Conferences","summary":"A new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks was developed to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in the densely irrigated area of Wisconsin central sands (WCS).","tags":["Stochastic hydrology","Hydrology Instruments and techniques","monitoring","Data mining-","Informatics","Machine learning"],"title":"Improving irrigation planning and early prediction for agricultural drought in Wisconsin","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Logan Ebert","Alex Chisholm","Jacob Prater","Samuel Zipper","Ammara Talib","Ankur Desai","Mallika Nocco (2020)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2020, H021-06’\nAbstract: A key challenge for bridging precision irrigation research and application is how best to monitor evapotranspiration (ET) and water stress in real-time. Eddy Covariance towers and lysimeters are vetted methods of monitoring ET and water stress but can lack field-size domains, spatial resolution, and be cost prohibitive. Remotely sensed data offer a potential solution to this problem. However, aerial and satellite imagery have the drawback of spatiotemporal resolution and cloud interference. Recent advancements in remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) have made frequent, low-flying optical and thermal imagery collection more economical and feasible than ever before. While low flight elevations improve image resolution and can reduce cloud interference, they require more imagery to cover a field and therefore increase battery usage and post-processing needs. In order to find the optimal RPA flight elevation for irrigation management, the goal of this study is to evaluate the influence of capture elevation on modeled ET values. The goal of our project was to evaluate the influence of capture elevation on modeled evapotranspiration values. The optical and thermal data were collected from a commercially irrigated potato field in the Wisconsin Central Sands during the 2019 growing season. A total of eight mission sets were flown. Each mission set was flown using a quadcopter RPA system and combined multispectral/thermal camera. Mission sets included flights at 90, 60, and 30 m above ground level.

The performance of land surface model-based AET, reanalysis, and remote sensing products varies at different spatio-temporal scales. In the Central Sands Regions of Wisconsin, irrigation agriculture plays a fundamental role in supporting regional agricultural production and rural community development. For irrigation scheduling, farmers often rely on the Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model, developed by soil scientists at UW-Madison and based on satellite data. WISP is a regional model based on the Priestley Taylor approach and provides Potential ET (PET) estimates that can be scaled to ET based on percent canopy cover.\nIn 2018, with support from the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Growers Association Water Task Force, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the UW Center for Climatic Research, our lab installed eddy covariance flux towers on a center-pivot irrigated potato field (US-CS1) from June 2018-May 2019, the Tri-County School Forest pine stand Sept 2018-, a 2nd potato field (US-CS3) from June 2019-June 2020, and a 3rd potato field (US-CS4) from June 2020-present. Links to graphs, tables, and publications are at project website [Water use in Wisconsin Potatoes and Pine] (https://flux.aos.wisc.edu/potato)\nThis research evaluates sources of bias in the WISP model and develops a correction using eddy covariance (EC) observations. AET observations were made for five years (2018–2022), using EC systems in irrigated potatoes fields in Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS) region. Multi-source ET datasets should be employed in future studies to enhance confidence in remotely sensed ET related water budgets.\nThe source of uncertainty in the model could be due to model inputs of coefficients used in empirical equations. Those coefficients are not regionally calibrated, which could lead to underestimating the energy budget. Wisconsin is humid, where ET is energy limited, and by correcting the energy budget, we expect to see reduced bias in model ET.\nThe WISP model overestimated ET before correction because modeled AET range for the WCS region was 7.17-7.48 mm before correction for July 19th, 2020, but after correction modeled AET_corr range was 5.59-5.86 mm. Total AET for the entire region for July 19th, 2020, is 569 mm before correction and 444.5 mm after modification, with a difference of 124.5 mm. Currently, I am working on validating our corrected version of the WISP model on other sites in WI with eddy-covariance energy flux towers.

Recent advancements in remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) have made frequent, low-flying imagery collection more economical and feasible than ever before. We partnered with the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Grower Association to generate high-resolution maps of crop water stress using remotely sensed thermal and multi-spectral RPA imagery. Data were collected at a commercially irrigated potato field in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin from June to August 2019. Missions were flown weekly using a quadcopter RPA system instrumented with a newly released, combined multispectral/thermal camera developed for agricultural applications. Each mission included flights at 30, 60, and 90 m above ground level to assess tradeoffs between resolution, area, and flight time. We used biophysical data from an eddy covariance system installed within the flight domain to validate crop water stress maps generated from the remotely sensed RPA data. Ground measurements of surface temperature and soil moisture were collected throughout the domain within fifteen minutes of each mission. Ongoing results will be used to develop best practices for integrating RPAs into precision irrigation programs.\n","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"c3660ffd97cebe6dc8f72f030fd0ad5d","permalink":"/conferences/using-remotely-piloted-aircrafts-to-evaluate-water-stress-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/using-remotely-piloted-aircrafts-to-evaluate-water-stress-2019/","section":"Conferences","summary":"Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) was used to generate high-resolution maps of crop water stress using remotely sensed thermal and multi-spectral RPA imagery in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin.","tags":["Remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs)","Atmospheric sciences","Hydrology"],"title":"Using remotely piloted aircrafts to evaluate potato water stress in Central Wisconsin","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Ankur R.Desai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557187200,"objectID":"88bba2f1c90b79eb91efa4978b967fa6","permalink":"/publication/featured_2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/featured_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"New technologies make the science of measuring ET a bit more tangible [Page 24-27](https://issuu.com/bctater/docs/1905_standard)","tags":null,"title":"Ways to Measure Evapotranspiration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Ankur R Desai (2019)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘UW Extension \u0026amp; Wisconsin Potato \u0026amp; Vegetable Growers Association (WPVGA) Grower Conference 2019’\nWays to measure ET:\nMeteorological approximations: Thornthwaite, Priestly-Taylor, Penman-Montieth – Strong assumptions on surface properties, ET driven by radiation\nResidual: Measure precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, back out ET – Subject to high uncertainty Lysimeters: Labor-intensive, small-area estimate\nRemote sensing: Assumptions on links between electromagnetic radiation and ET, satellites don’t work with clouds\nProcess models: Captures all aspects but requires extensive, hard to measure parameters\nEddy covariance: Direct method, whole field, expensive and expertise required\nMachine “Learning”: Site-specific, hard to extrapolate or interpret, but powerful for forecasting\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549324800,"objectID":"cc33d9b63fb6246831403e730ef1c9ee","permalink":"/conferences/what-have-we-learned-wpvgafeb2020/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/what-have-we-learned-wpvgafeb2020/","section":"Conferences","summary":"We can better quantify evapotranspiration (ET) to improve our understanding of the Central Sands water cycle and improve irrigation demand forecasting.","tags":["Machine learning","Remote sensing","Forecasting","Models"],"title":"What have we learned from continuous crop and forest evapotranspiration observations in the Central Sands?","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Ankur R.Desai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544572800,"objectID":"48f99dcae8c1bcfa82e5b79f6b75eab5","permalink":"/publication/featured_2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/featured_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Eddy covariance Flux Towers allow scientists to directly observe changes in plant water use [Page 21-23](https://issuu.com/bctater/docs/1812_standard)","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Evapotranspiration on an irrigated potato field and pine plantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Ankur R Desai (2018)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018, H21J-1787’\nAbstract: The Central Sands region of Wisconsin is one of the most agriculturally productive regions of the United States because of supplemental irrigation with groundwater. About 2,290 high capacity groundwater (GW) wells in shallow sandy and gravel aquifer are being used to irrigate potatoes, sweet corn, peas and bean. These high capacity wells withdraw and pump about 100,000 gallons of water per day and are also draining streams and lakes. Changes in precipitation and temperature has also increased the length of growing season in WCS. Improved understanding of groundwater level response to climate patterns and pumping is essential for sustainable planning and management, particularly in the context of increasing groundwater demands in agriculture. As an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models, here we evaluate the reliability of a machine learning based GW model using environmental drivers to GW fluctuation. The objectives were to: 1) develop a new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in WCS, and 2) determine the relative influence of climate variability, evapotranspiration (ET) and crop irrigation demand on GW level change. Precipitation and temperature, streamflow and other climatic indices were chosen as predictors, which make the selected approach easily transferable, since that data is widely available and simple to measure. We trained our model with input data in WCS from 2012-2015 and tested for 2016-2017. Our results show that at least for WCS, our modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater level change and water availability, especially in regions where subsurface properties are unknown. An easy to use and rapidly run model also benefits farmers who can identify areas where GW is depleting and thus avoid those regions or grow either non- irrigating crops or crops that recharge GW.Understanding the nonlinear relationship between climate, GW pumping and surface water is also crucial for scientist and conservation professionals, to help protect areas with potential for highest GW depletion. A future application of this work will be to predict crop yield by identifying the important drivers that affect GW level.\n","date":1544486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544486400,"objectID":"ae0202d8a28becd076d2a9db8168eb49","permalink":"/conferences/efficacy-of-machine-learning-algorithms-2018/","publishdate":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/efficacy-of-machine-learning-algorithms-2018/","section":"Conferences","summary":"A new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks was developed to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in the densely irrigated area of Wisconsin central sands (WCS).","tags":["Stochastic hydrology","Hydrology Instruments and techniques","monitoring","Data mining-","Informatics","Machine learning"],"title":"Efficacy of Machine Learning Algorithms for Identifying Hotspots of Groundwater Depletion in Intensively Irrigated Agricultural Regions","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Mallika Arudi Nocco","Elizabeth O McNamee","Brian Bohman","Ammara Talib","Carl J Rosen","Ankur R Desai","Christel C Kern","Christopher J Kucharik","Tracy E Twine (2018)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018, H11J-1598’\nAbstract: Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan are experiencing conversion from forests to irrigated potato and vegetable production in coarse soils overlying unconfined aquifers. Groundwater and surface water are strongly connected in these regions, where baseflow often exceeds 80% of streamflow. Watersheds that have already undergone heavy irrigated land use conversion (e.g., Wisconsin Central Sands) currently struggle with surface water loss and ecological degradation. Though it is well understood that forests provide regulatory ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration, the spatiotemporal changes to the hydrological budget associated with irrigated land use conversion across the northern Great Lakes states are unclear. Irrigation-induced depletion is a localized and episodic process in this humid region where precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration by 200-300 mm yr-1. Irrigated land use conversion may increase or decrease net annual groundwater recharge by 50 mm depending on the methodology (e.g., remote sensing vs. semi-empirical hydrological modeling) and spatial scale used to develop estimates. Policymakers and water managers require more information about how irrigated land use conversion changes the timing and magnitude of net groundwater recharge as well as the interannual variability associated with these changes. Our goal is to better understand historical and potential hydrological impacts of pine to potato conversion across the northern Great Lakes region. To this end, we developed and validated mid and late season potato plant functional types for the process-based AgroIBIS-VSF model using lysimetry, eddy covariance, phenological, and physiological data from several sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Using AgroIBIS-VSF, we examined how pine and mixed forest conversion to irrigated mid and late season potato agroecosystems altered monthly and annual groundwater recharge between 1979-2016. Preliminary results reveal significant interannual variability in groundwater recharge and potential tradeoffs between groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration ecosystem services.

However,stream channelization, past wetland drainage, and ground water withdrawals have disrupted the hydrology of this CentralSands region. Climatically driven conditions in last decade (2000-2008) alone are unable to account for the severelydepressed water levels. Increased interception and evapotranspiration from afforested areas in central sand Wisconsinmay also be culprit for reduced water recharge. Hence, there is need to study the cumulative effects of changingprecipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lakelevels and water availability in this region.Here, the SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale. The coupled model fullyintegrates a watershed model (SWAT) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Surface water and ground water flowswere simulated integratively at daily time step to estimate the groundwater discharge to the stream network in CentralSands that encompasses high capacity wells. The model was calibrated (2010-2013) and validated (2014-2017) based onstreamflow, groundwater extraction, and water table elevation. As the long-term trends in some of the primary drivers is presently ambiguous in Central Sands under future climate, as isthe case for total precipitation or timing of precipitation, we relied on a sensitivity student to quantitatively access howprimary and secondary drivers may influence future net groundwater recharge. We demonstrate how such an approachcould then be coupled with decision-making models to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater withdrawal policiesunder a changing climate.\n","date":1513123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513123200,"objectID":"0d856a35353ab23b20a252a9b491a46c","permalink":"/conferences/groundwater-surface-water-interaction-in-dense-network-of-high-capacity-wells-2017/","publishdate":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/groundwater-surface-water-interaction-in-dense-network-of-high-capacity-wells-2017/","section":"Conferences","summary":"The SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale to study the cumulative effects of changing precipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lake levels and water availability in agricultural regions.","tags":["Drought","Hydrology","Eco-hydrology","Floods","Water management","Coupled models"],"title":"Groundwater-Surface water interaction in agricultural watershed that encompasses dense network of High Capacity wells","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Timothy O.Randhir"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"f42957d562645933c4dd9a0e91392aee","permalink":"/publication/managing-emerging-contaminants-2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/managing-emerging-contaminants-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose comprehensive management using sources, transfer and fate of emerging contaminants.
